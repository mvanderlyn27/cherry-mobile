# Todo 
- build out explore page
- build account page
- build reader page
- setup anonymous acount creation
- setup interaction tracking
- animations
   - Can we get animations to play every time you go to a page without re-rendeirng all the images/ fucking performance?
- setup posthog
    - logging service (posthog)
- setup ftux

    - implement payment with anon accounts/logged in accounts
- setup admob
