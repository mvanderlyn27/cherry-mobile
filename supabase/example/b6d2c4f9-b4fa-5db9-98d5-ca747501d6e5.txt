Chapter 2

The first few days in Port Blossom passed in a blur of dust cloths, inventory lists, and lukewarm tea brewed on a temperamental hot plate in the tiny kitchenette upstairs. The flat above the shop was small but cosy, with sloping ceilings, mismatched furniture, and a window seat overlooking the bustling harbour. It felt like Isobel, too – practical, a little quirky, and filled with character. Elara found herself sleeping more soundly than she had in years, lulled by the distant foghorn and the cries of the gulls.

Downstairs, the shop was slowly yielding its secrets. Elara spent hours carefully unrolling maps, her fingers tracing coastlines drawn centuries ago, marvelling at the artistry of sea monsters lurking in unexplored oceans and the elegant script naming newly discovered lands. She found drawers filled with pigments ground from minerals, slivers of mother-of-pearl for inlay work, and tools so fine they looked like surgical instruments. Isobel hadn't just restored maps; she’d inhabited their world.

There were business ledgers, too, surprisingly meticulous, detailing commissions from collectors, museums, and even local families wanting ancestral charts preserved. Isobel had made a living, Liam O’Connell’s skepticism notwithstanding. Elara felt a surge of determination. She would continue it. She started drafting emails to Isobel’s old clients, introducing herself, assuring them of her commitment to the craft she’d learned first as a hobby, then honed through specialized courses.

Her neighbour remained a noisy, enigmatic presence. The roar of machinery often started promptly at eight AM and, true to his word, usually ceased around six. Sometimes, the rhythmic clang of a hammer against metal replaced the shriek of the saw, or the gentler rasp of sandpapering wood drifted through the shared wall. Elara found herself listening, cataloguing the sounds, imagining Liam moving within his space, shaping wood and metal with those strong, capable-looking hands.

She saw him occasionally – loading timber onto a trolley, talking gruffly with weathered-looking fishermen down by the quay, or simply standing outside his workshop for a moment, staring out at the sea with an intensity that made her feel intrusive even from her window. He never initiated conversation, offering only a brief nod if their paths crossed directly, his stormy eyes giving nothing away. He was a closed book, written in a language she didn’t understand.

One damp Tuesday morning, wrestling with a stuck window latch in the shop front, Elara heard a cheerful voice behind her.

"Need a hand there, dearie?"

She turned to see a small, round woman with bright pink lipstick, twinkling blue eyes, and a cloud of white candy-floss hair escaping from beneath a knitted yellow beret. She carried a wicker basket overflowing with vegetables.

"Oh! Um, yes, if you wouldn't mind," Elara said, grateful for the interruption. "It seems determined to stay shut."

The woman bustled forward, setting her basket down. "Ah, these old frames swell up fierce in the damp. I'm Betty Gable, by the way. Run the wool shop, two doors down from the bakery." She gave the window frame a knowing wiggle and a firm thump in just the right spot. With a groan, the latch released.

"There we go! Nothing a bit of know-how won't fix." Betty beamed at her. "You must be Isobel's girl? The great-niece?"

"Elara Vance," Elara confirmed, smiling back. Betty’s warmth was infectious. "It's lovely to meet you, Mrs. Gable."

"Betty, please! We're not formal here. Welcome to Port Blossom! Such a shame about Isobel, bless her. A real character, she was. Part of the furniture, you know? We all miss her." Betty’s gaze swept over the shop interior, visible through the now-open window. "Looks like you're getting stuck in, though. Brave thing, taking this on."

"It's… a lot," Elara admitted. "But fascinating. Isobel left an incredible legacy."

"That she did," Betty agreed. "Clever hands, she had. Just like her father. Old Thomas, the clockmaker. Genius with tiny fiddly bits." She leaned in conspiratorially. "So, how are you finding our Liam, next door?"

Elara felt a blush creep up her neck. "Liam? Mr. O'Connell? He seems… busy."

Betty chuckled, a sound like rattling knitting needles. "Busy is one word for it. Broody's another. Hasn't been the same since…" She paused, her expression clouding slightly. "Well, never you mind that. He keeps himself to himself mostly, does Liam. Good lad, though, deep down. Salt of the earth, like his father before him. O'Connells have been building boats in that workshop for nigh on a hundred years."

"A hundred years?" Elara was impressed. That explained the deep sense of rootedness she felt emanating from him.

"Aye. Proper Port Blossom stock. Not like us blow-ins." Betty winked, though Elara suspected Betty had been here for decades herself. "He took over young, when his dad passed. Works all the hours God sends. Married to that workshop, some say."

This snippet of information lodged itself in Elara’s mind. Took over young. Married to the workshop. It painted a slightly different picture than just a grumpy neighbour.

"Well," Elara said, trying to sound casual. "He certainly makes his presence known with the noise."

"Ah, yes," Betty sighed. "The price of living next to industry, I suppose. Still, better than when old Mr. Henderson had the fish gutting business there! Phew!" She wrinkled her nose dramatically. "Listen, dearie, if you need anything – anything at all – finding suppliers, navigating the council, figuring out who delivers milk – you just pop into the wool shop, alright?"

"Thank you, Betty. That's incredibly kind." Elara felt a genuine warmth spread through her. Maybe settling here wouldn't be so isolating after all.

"Think nothing of it! We look after our own here." Betty picked up her basket. "Right, must dash. Pot roast waits for no woman!" With another cheerful wave, she bustled off down Harbour Lane.

Elara watched her go, then turned back to the shop, feeling lighter. Betty's friendly chatter had blown through the dusty corners of her uncertainty like a fresh sea breeze. She spent the rest of the day meticulously cataloguing a set of celestial charts, the delicate constellations sparking her imagination.

Late that afternoon, as the light began to fade, she was carefully cleaning a fragile 18th-century map of the Cornish coast when a shadow fell across her drafting table. She looked up, startled, her heart giving an unwarranted jump.

Liam O’Connell stood in the open doorway, silhouetted against the fading light. He wasn't wearing his overalls today, just dark jeans and the same grey t-shirt, which looked softer now, less like workwear. He held a small, sturdy-looking cardboard box.

"Shop was open," he stated, his voice quieter than usual. He stepped inside, his presence seeming to fill the small space. He glanced around, taking in the ordered piles, the cleared surfaces, the scent of lemon oil polish that had replaced some of the dust. His stormy eyes finally landed on the map spread across her table.

"Isobel left this for you," he said, holding out the box. "Found it tucked away in the back of my workshop. Must have got mixed in with some of my timber orders ages ago. Forgot about it till I was clearing out that corner yesterday."

Elara carefully wiped her hands on a clean cloth before taking the box. It was heavier than it looked. "Oh. Thank you."

"It's addressed to 'My Intrepid Niece'," he added, a faint, almost imperceptible quirk lifting the corner of his mouth. It wasn't quite a smile, but it softened the harsh lines of his face momentarily.

Elara looked down at the box. In Isobel’s familiar, looping script, the label read exactly that. A lump formed in her throat. "Thank you, Liam. For finding it. And bringing it over."

He just nodded, his gaze drifting back to the map she was working on. "Risky, working on something that old."

"It requires patience," Elara agreed, finding her voice. "And a steady hand."

He looked from the map to her hands, currently resting on the edge of the table. Slender fingers, stained faintly with ink. A stark contrast to his own, which she noticed were clean now, but roughened, with faded scars crisscrossing the knuckles. He met her eyes, and for a moment, the air crackled with an unspoken awareness. It was the same intensity she'd seen when he looked at the sea, but this time, it was directed at her.

"Right," he said, breaking the contact first, as always. He cleared his throat. "Well. Just wanted to drop that off."

"I appreciate it," Elara said sincerely.

He gave another curt nod and turned to leave. Just before he stepped out, he paused. "The noise… If it's ever too much, after six or something, just bang on the wall."

The offer surprised her. "Oh. Okay. Thanks."

He disappeared back into the twilight, leaving Elara alone with the unexpected gift and the lingering echo of his presence. She looked down at the box, then back towards his workshop. Liam O’Connell. Still an enigma, still broody, but maybe, just maybe, not entirely unapproachable. She carefully placed the box on a cleared shelf, deciding to open it later, when she could give it her full attention. For now, she turned back to her map, but her focus wasn't quite as sharp as before. The sounds from the workshop next door suddenly seemed less like an intrusion and more like a steady, rhythmic counterpoint to the quiet concentration of her own work.
