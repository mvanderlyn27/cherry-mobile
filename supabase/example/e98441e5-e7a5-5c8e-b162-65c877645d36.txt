Chapter 3

The box from Liam remained unopened for two days. Elara kept glancing at it, perched on the shelf like a silent promise or a puzzle box. Part of her was hesitant, knowing anything from Isobel might trigger a fresh wave of grief or expectation. Another part, the part she was less willing to admit to, felt that opening it would somehow close the small, unexpected connection forged by Liam bringing it over.

Life in Port Blossom was finding its rhythm. Elara established a routine: early mornings spent exploring the coastal paths before the village properly woke up, long days immersed in the delicate work of the shop, and evenings curled up in the window seat upstairs, reading or researching restoration techniques. She exchanged greetings with more locals – Mr. Davies the baker, who saved her a sourdough loaf on Saturdays; young Chloe who worked at the tiny post office and knew everyone’s business; Finn, the lanky teenager who helped Liam out at the workshop sometimes after school.

She learned to navigate the ebb and flow of Harbour Lane: the morning bustle of fishermen heading out, the lunchtime lull, the afternoon influx of day-trippers if the sun was shining, the quiet peace of the evenings. And always, the background hum, grind, or clang from Number 16.

Liam remained a peripheral figure. They exchanged nods, the occasional "Morning," but nothing more substantive. Yet, Elara found herself hyper-aware of him. She noticed the way he moved with an economy of motion, the slight furrow that often creased his brow when he was concentrating, the rare occasions she heard him laugh – a deep, rumbling sound – while talking to Finn. She was charting him, she realized wryly, mapping the contours of his moods and habits from sparse observations.

One Thursday morning, the unmistakable smell of burning wires crept into the shop. Elara sniffed the air, her stomach clenching. It grew stronger, accompanied by a faint crackling sound. Panic rising, she traced the smell to a junction box high on the wall near the ceiling – a relic, ancient and dust-covered. A thin wisp of smoke curled from its edge.

Heart pounding, she grabbed the fire extinguisher Isobel had kept near the door – checking frantically that the gauge was still in the green – and dragged a sturdy wooden stool over. Just as she was about to climb up, the shop door burst open.

Liam stood there, extinguisher in hand, his face grim. "Smelled smoke. You alright?"

"The junction box!" Elara pointed, relieved beyond measure to see him. "It started crackling."

Without a word, Liam strode past her, assessed the situation in a glance, and expertly aimed his extinguisher, releasing a short, controlled burst of powder that smothered the smoke. He then moved swiftly to the main fuse box near the door, flicking switches until the power to the shop cut out, plunging the space into dimmer, natural light.

"Okay," he said, breathing a little faster now, the adrenaline fading. "Looks like the wiring finally gave up. It's ancient." He ran a hand through his sawdust-dusted hair. "You need to get an electrician in, pronto. Don't touch those fuses."

Elara leaned against the drafting table, her legs suddenly shaky. "Okay. Right. Electrician." She took a deep breath. "Thank you, Liam. You were so fast."

"Instinct," he shrugged, setting his extinguisher down. He looked around the now powerless shop. "Means you've got no power for your fancy lights or…" He gestured vaguely. "Whatever it is you use."

"My magnification lamp, dehumidifier, kettle…" Elara listed mentally. "Pretty much everything."

"Right." He surveyed the old junction box again. "Look, Pete Matthews is the best electrician round here, but he's usually booked solid. Let me give him a call. Might come quicker for me."

"Would you? I wouldn't know who to call." Gratitude washed over her. "I owe you. Big time."

He waved a dismissive hand. "Neighbours, right?" He pulled out his phone, his thumb moving efficiently across the screen as he walked towards the door where the signal was better. Elara watched him, the set of his shoulders, the low murmur of his voice as he spoke to Pete, cajoling, explaining. He wasn't just gruffness and machinery; there was a competence, a reliability about him that was incredibly reassuring.

He ended the call. "Okay. Pete's swamped, but he'll try and swing by late this afternoon. Said not to touch anything till he gets here."

"Thank you, Liam. Really."

"No problem." He hesitated, glancing around the dim shop. "Means you're stuck, though. No work you can do?"

"Not much without power," Elara admitted. "I could sort through some paperwork, I suppose." The prospect felt bleak after the morning’s excitement and her subsequent relief.

An uncharacteristic awkwardness seemed to settle over Liam. He shifted his weight. "Well… I was about to grab a coffee down at The Salty Mug. If you… uh… fancy joining me? Seeing as you can't make one here."

The invitation hung in the air, unexpected and tentative. Elara stared at him. Was Liam O’Connell asking her for coffee?

"I… yes," she heard herself say, surprising herself. "Yes, that would be lovely. Thank you."

A flicker of surprise crossed his own face, quickly masked. "Right. Grab your coat, then."

They walked the short distance to the harbour front café in a slightly stilted silence. The Salty Mug was warm and steamy, smelling of coffee beans and bacon. It was busy, filled with fishermen taking a break, locals catching up, and a few hardy tourists. Liam nodded greetings to several people as they found a small table by the window overlooking the fishing boats bobbing in the water.

"My treat," he said firmly as the waitress approached. "Seeing as I technically broke your electrics."

"You didn't break them, they self-destructed," Elara countered, but she smiled. "But thank you."

They ordered – Liam a large black coffee, Elara a latte – and settled back. The café buzz provided a comfortable background hum, easing the pressure.

"So," Liam began, stirring sugar into his coffee with unnecessary vigour. "Map restoration. How'd you get into that?"

It was the first personal question he’d ever asked her. Elara found herself telling him about her lifelong love of old things, her history degree, the short course she took on paper conservation that ignited a passion, and how she practiced on flea market finds while working her sensible graphic design job.

"Isobel encouraged me," she finished softly. "Sent me articles, sometimes old damaged charts to practice on. I never thought… I never expected this."

Liam listened intently, his stormy eyes fixed on her face. He didn't interrupt, just absorbed her words. "She always did her own thing, Isobel," he said eventually, a note of respect in his voice. "Didn't care what anyone thought."

"Were you close?" Elara asked tentatively.

He took a slow sip of his coffee. "Knew her all my life. Used to sneak into her shop when I was a kid. Fascinated by all the weird tools and the drawings of dragons." A faint smile touched his lips again, more genuine this time. "She caught me once, trying to 'borrow' a magnifying glass. Didn't shout. Just sat me down and showed me how to use it properly to look at the rigging on a model ship she had."

Elara smiled, picturing a small, curious Liam. "That sounds like her."

"She kept an eye out," he continued, his gaze drifting out the window towards the sea. "After my dad… died. My mum wasn't coping too well. Isobel used to drop off casseroles. Never made a big deal of it." His voice roughened slightly on the word 'died'.

Betty Gable’s words echoed in Elara’s mind: Took over young, when his dad passed. Suddenly, his reserve, his dedication to the workshop, seemed less like intentional aloofness and more like a fortress built over grief and responsibility.

"That must have been incredibly hard," Elara said softly. "Taking over the business so young."

He looked back at her, his gaze direct, searching. "You do what you have to do," he said simply, but there was a wealth of unspoken history in the words. "Boats are in the blood. Couldn't imagine doing anything else. Or being anywhere else."

There was a challenge in his tone again, a subtle testing of her own intentions.

"It's beautiful here," Elara admitted honestly. "But very different from London. I don't know if I have 'Port Blossom' in my blood yet."

"It takes time," he said. "Or it doesn't. You'll know soon enough if you're meant to stay."

They sat in a more comfortable silence then, sipping their coffees, watching the life of the harbour unfold outside the window. Elara felt a shift, a subtle realignment in her perception of Liam. The gruff exterior was still there, but she’d glimpsed the layers beneath – responsibility, loss, a deep connection to this place, and unexpected kindness.

When they finished, Liam insisted on paying. Walking back towards their adjacent buildings, the earlier awkwardness had dissipated, replaced by a tentative ease.

"Thanks again, Liam," Elara said as they reached her shop door. "For the rescue, the electrician, and the coffee."

"Anytime," he replied. He looked at her, really looked at her, a warmth creeping into his sea-storm eyes. "Let me know what Pete says."

"I will."

He lingered for a second longer, then gave a nod and headed towards his own workshop. Elara watched him go, a strange fluttering sensation in her chest. She turned towards her dark, silent shop, but it didn't feel quite so daunting now. The power might be out, but something else felt like it had just been switched on. She finally felt ready to open Isobel's box.
